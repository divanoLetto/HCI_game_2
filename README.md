## Installation

The project need the following libraries: 
* Tensorflow 2.2.0
* Tensorforce 0.5.5
The latest versions of the remaining required libraries can be used.

In addition, the backups of the agents and the framework necessary to use them can be found at this [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-h5oJv1MsJ-lxjT5vHgujoqfLluG1l5a?usp=sharing "files")

## Usage

In order to run the program simply run python3 main.py`.
 
The following is the original abstract of the project.

# Project Abstract 
*The intent of this paper is to verify if appropriate Deep Reinforcement Learning strategies can prove effective for the realization of non-player characters in a video game such as to have a credible behavior and able to provide a pleasant and stimulating game challenge for the user. 
For this purpose, a turn-based roguelike prototype has been created in which the adversary agents are made through DRL methods through the framework created by Alessandro Sestini, Alexander Kuhnle and Andrew D. Bagdanov and described in the article [1]. 
The agents obtained were tested quantitatively and qualitatively in order to determine if their final behavior was convincing according to the set objectives. Finally, an evaluation was given to the framework used to create the agents.*

# Repository Requirements

This code was written in Pytorch 1.1. We use tensorboardX for the visualisation of the training metrics. We recommend setting up a virtual environment using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). To install Pytorch in a conda environment, simply run 

```
$ conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

Then the rest of the requirements can be installed with 

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Mesh Decimation
For the mesh decimation code we use a function from the [COMA repository](https://github.com/anuragranj/coma) (the files **mesh_sampling.py** and **shape_data.py** - previously **facemesh.py** - were taken from the COMA repo and adapted to our needs). In order to decimate your template mesh, you will need the [MPI-Mesh](https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh) package (a mesh library similar to Trimesh or Open3D).  This package requires Python 2. However once you have cached the generated downsampling and upsampling matrices, it is possible to run the rest of the code with Python 3 as well, if necessary.


# Data Organization

The following is the organization of the dataset directories expected by the code:

* data **root_dir**/
  * **dataset** name/ (eg DFAUST)
    * template
      * template.obj (all of the spiraling and downsampling code is run on the template only once)
      * downsample_method/
        * downsampling_matrices.pkl (created by the code the first time you run it)
    * preprocessed/
      * train.npy (number_meshes, number_vertices, 3) (no Faces because they all share topology)
      * test.npy 
      * points_train/ (created by data_generation.py)
      * points_val/ (created by data_generation.py)
      * points_test/ (created by data_generation.py)
      * paths_train.npy (created by data_generation.py)
      * paths_val.npy (created by data_generation.py)
      * paths_test.npy (created by data_generation.py)

# Usage

#### Data preprocessing 

In order to use a pytorch dataloader for training and testing, we split the data into seperate files by:

```
$ python data_generation.py --root_dir=/path/to/data_root_dir --dataset=DFAUST --num_valid=100
```

#### Training and Testing

For training and testing of the mesh autoencoder, we provide an ipython notebook, which you can run with 

```
$ jupyter notebook neural3dmm.ipynb
```

The first time you run the code, it will check if the downsampling matrices are cached (calculating the downsampling and upsampling matrices takes a few minutes), and then the spirals will be calculated on the template (**spiral_utils.py** file).

In the 2nd cell of the notebook one can specify their directories, hyperparameters (sizes of the filters, optimizer) etc. All this information is stored in a dictionary named _args_ that is used throughout the rest of the code. In order to run the notebook in train or test mode, simply set:

```
args['mode'] = 'train' or 'test'
```

#### Some important notes:
* The code has compatibility with both _mpi-mesh_ and _trimesh_ packages (it can be chosen by setting the _meshpackage_ variable in the first cell of the notebook).
* The reference points parameter needs exactly one vertex index per disconnected component of the mesh. So for DFAUST you only need one, but for COMA which has the eyes as diconnected components, you need a reference point on the head as well as one on each eye.
* **spiral_utils.py**: In order to get the spiral ordering for each neighborhood, the spiraling code works by walking along the triangulation exploiting the fact that the tri
